# Lesson 1: Introduction to Probability and Statistics

## Probability Theory
Probability Theory is a ,athematical framework for computing the probability of complex events under the assumption taht we know the probabilities of the basic events.

## Flipping coins
When flipping a fair coin, the probability of the outcome being heads is the same as of it being tails.

Say, if we flip a coin 10,000 times, the number of heads should be about 5,000. We say about 5,000 instead of equal to 5,000 because the number will never be exactly 5,000. However, the greater the amount of tosses, the closer it'll get to that number.

There is a boundary for all the probabilities; the absolute value sum of the probabilities will be bigger than or equal to 4 times the square root of the number of coin throws. Anything outside that can be seen as a biased coin.

The Python Notebook 1.What-is-Probability explains more about this concept and simulates throwing coins.
